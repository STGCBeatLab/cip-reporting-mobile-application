    'In order for this lookup to work, your CIP Reporting server and email address must have been configured in the CIP Reporting account lookup service.\n' +
    'Simply enter your email address and select **Look Up Account**.  If your CIP Reporting server can be found you will be prompted for your password.\n' +
