    'You must have access to a CIP Reporting server which has been configured for mobile access to use this application.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Accessing Your Account\n' +
    'You can access your account (login) on the CIP Reporting Mobile client either by an automatic lookup using your email address or by manually\n' +
    'specifying the full set of credentials to your CIP Reporting server.  Once you have authenticated in the CIP Reporting Mobile client you will\n' +
    'not be prompted to authenticate again unless there are changes to your account.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '*We highly recommend using the Account Lookup option.*\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Account Look Up\n' +
    'The account lookup tool attempts to cross reference your email address with a known CIP Reporting server.\n' +
    'In order for this lookup to work, your CIP Reporting server and email address must have been configured in the CIP Reporting account lookup service.\n' +
    'Simply enter your email address and select **Look Up Account**.  If your CIP Reporting server can be found you will be prompted for your password.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '#### Failure to Look Up Account\n' +

    '\n' +
    '* Try a different email address\n' +
    '* Use the manual authentication method\n' +

    'In order to manually sign into the CIP Reporting Mobile client you must have a complete set of credentials.\n' +
    'You can obtain these credentials from your IT department. The credentials required to find your CIP Reporting server ' +
    'and authenticate are:\n' +

    '* Your Report Engine Name\n' +
    '* Your User Name\n' +
    '* Your User Context\n' +
    '* Your Password\n' +
    '\n' +
    'You can enter your credentials manually by selecting the **Manual Sign In** link found on the account look up screen.\n' +

    'You can force a synchronization to both update the available forms and submit reports by clicking the **Synchronize** menu option at any time.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Writing Reports Offline\n' +
    'When you write reports without a network connection they are stored locally on the device.\n' +
    'The reports will be sent when a network connection is available as long as the application is in the foreground on your device.\n' +
    'If you close the application or activate another application you must return to the application when a network connection is available for the reports to be sent.\n' +
